`
```{r}
#road the parent data
parent <- read.csv("parent.csv")
parent
```
```{r}
#plot a scatterplot and write down your observation
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(parent, aes(x = parent, y= child )) + geom_point() + geom_smooth()
```
#observation 
the height of parent seems to relate with child's height because the smooth line is positive.


```{r}
#Fit a regression model for child's height
library(ISLR)
library(MASS)
mod1 <- lm(child ~ parent, data = parent)
mod1
```
```{r}
#Give a summary of your model
summary(mod1)
```
```{r}
# For parent whose height is 68 in, predict the height of their child. Use predict()
predict(mod1, data.frame(parent = c(68)))
```
