# The goal is to "Predict purchase amount"
# This dataset comprises of sales transactions captured at a retail store. Itâ€™s a classic dataset to explore and expand your feature engineering skills and day to day understanding from multiple shopping experiences. This is a regression problem. The dataset has 550,069 rows and 12 columns.
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r}
train <- read_csv("train.csv")
test <- read_csv("test.csv")
train
test
```

```{r}
# Categorical: Gender, Age, City Categoruy, Marital status(marriage), Occupation
# numerical: Product category1, product category2, product category3, Purchase
summary(train)
```
```{r}
# 550068 rows and 12 variables
str(train)
```

# Check all categorical variables
```{r}
# 7 classes have in Age
# City category has three (A, C, B)
# Stay in Current City Years has 5 categories
# Marital status is 0 or 1
